Tap Into NFC is a developer program initiated by the NFC Forum to support and encourage development of NFC-enabled applications. We really appreciate the NFC Forum's dedication and efforts to create this innovative community that will drive NFC based innovation.</p><ul class="inline-list"></ul></div></div><hr/><div class="row"><div class="large-2 columns small-3"><img src="img/bio-dave.png"/></div><div class="large-10 columns"><a name="dave-sept-10"></a><p><strong>Posted on September 10, 2014 at 7:45 PM</strong><br/><br/>Dave Wentker conducting a Tapcentive demo utilizing our NFC/BLE powered Connected Touchpoint at CTIA's Money Event!</p><img src="img/dave-blog-event.jpg"/><br/><br/><ul class="inline-list"></ul></div></div><hr/><div class="row"><div class="large-2 columns small-3"><img src="img/bio-dave.png"/></div><div class="large-10 columns"><a name="dave-sept-8"></a><p><strong>Posted on September 8, 2014 at 8:00 AM</strong><br/><br/><em>Since we quietly launched back in June, the team has been tirelessly rolling out new features and end-to-end enhancements on the platform based on feedback from users in our Developer Preview. In addition, the pre-production run and testing of our Connected Touchpoints went very well and I'm pleased to announce that we are officially launching our Connected Touchpoints today. We'll be demonstrating the Connected Touchpoints at the Money Event (booth #6146) in Las Vegas, NV on September 9th to 11th.</em></p><p>Connected Touchpoints combine advanced NFC and BLE capabilities in one device along with an M2M interface for remote management and monitoring. With Connected Touchpoints and our SDKs, you can deliver consistent user experiences across both Android and iPhone.<br/><br/>We're also excited to be covered today in VentureBeat.<br/><br/>We still have more to do to get our open development platform launched to the public, but in the meantime, we are continuing to take requests for our Developer Preview. As mentioned, the Developer Preview requires an NFC phone but you don't have to have any NFC development experience to accomplish some really cool things.<br/><br/>If you are interested in a demo of our new Connected Touchpoints and platform, or might be interested in VAR opportunities, we want to hear from you too!<br/><br/>Please contact us at info@tapcentive.com</p><ul class="inline-list"></ul></div></div></div><aside class="large-3 columns hide-for-small"></aside></div>
