And mobile commerce really gets interesting when mobile experiences become a part of physical commerce. <br/><br/>Our goal at Tapcentive is to create a state-of-the-art mobile engagement platform that enables marketers and developers to create entirely new customers experiences in physical locations &ndash; all with the absolute minimum of technology development. <br/><br/>We think you&rsquo;ll like what we&rsquo;ve built so far. And just as mobile technology is constantly evolving, so is the Tapcentive platform. Give it a test drive today.<p></p></h6><img src="./img/hardware-desk.jpg"/><p></p><br/><a name="careers"></a><h3>We&apos;re always looking for thought leaders<br/><h6>If you&apos;re passionate about this industry and looking for a change-up, send us your resume!</h6></h3><p>Send resumes to tim@tapcentive.com.</p><br/><br/><a name="press"></a><h3>We&apos;ve been on the news!<br/><h6></h6></h3><p>PR Links go here</p></div></div></section></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></ion-content></ion-view>
